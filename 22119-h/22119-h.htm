PREFACE.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> text of this edition of Persius
is in the main that of Jahn’s last recension (1868). The few changes are
discussed in the Notes and recorded in the Critical Appendix.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the Notes I have made large use of Jahn’s
standard edition, without neglecting the commentaries of Casaubon,
König, and Heinrich, or the later editions by Macleane, Pretor, and
Conington, or such recent monographs on Persius as I have been able to
procure. Special obligations have received special acknowledgment.</p>

<p>My personal contributions to the elucidation of Persius are too
slight to warrant me in following the prevalent fashion and cataloguing
the merits of my work under the modest guise of aims and endeavors.
I&nbsp;shall be contenf, if I have succeeded in making Persius less
distasteful to the general student; more than content, if those who have
devoted long and patient study to
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
this difficult author shall accord me the credit of an honest effort to
make myself acquainted with the poet himself as well as with his chief
commentators.</p>

<p>In compliance with the wish of the distinguished scholar at whose
instance I undertook this work, Professor Charles Short, of Columbia
College, New York, I&nbsp;have inserted references to my Latin Grammar
and to the Grammar of Allen and Greenough, here and there to Madvig.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">An</span> ancient <i>Vita Persii</i>, of
uncertain authorship, of evident authenticity, gives all that it is
needful for us to know about our poet&mdash;much more than is vouchsafed
to us for the rich individuality of Lucilius, much more than we can
divine for the unsubstantial character of Juvenal.</p>

<p>Aulus Persius Flaccus was born on the day before the nones of
December, A.U.C. 787, A.D. 34, at Volaterrae, in Etruria. That Luna in
Liguria was his birthplace is a false inference of some scholars from
the words <i>meum mare</i> in a passage of the sixth satire, where he
describes his favorite resort on the Riviera.</p>

<p>The family of Persius belonged to the old Etruscan nobility, and more
than one Persius appears in inscriptions found at Volaterrae. Other
circumstances make for his Etruscan origin: the Etruscan form of his
name, <i>Aules</i>, so written in most MSS. of his Life; the Etruscan
name of his mother, Sisennia; the familiar spitefulness of his mention
of Arretium, the allusions to the Tuscan haruspex, to the Tuscan
pedigree; the sneering mention of the Umbrians&mdash;fat-witted folk,
who lived across the Tuscan border. Most of these, it is true, are
minute points, and would be of little weight in the case of an author of
wider vision, but well-nigh conclusive in a writer like Persius, who
tried to make up for the narrowness of his personal experience by a
microscopic attention to details.</p>

<p>Persius belonged to the same sphere of society as Maecenas. Like
Maecenas an Etruscan, he was, like Maecenas,
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
an <i>eques Romanus</i>. The social class of which he was a member did
much for Roman literature; Etruria’s contributions were far less
valuable, and Mommsen is right when he recognizes in both these men, so
unlike in life and in principle&mdash;the one a callous wordling, the
other a callow philosopher&mdash;the stamp of their strange race,
a&nbsp;race which is a puzzle rather than a mystery. Indeed, the
would-be mysterious is one of the most salient points in the style of
Persius as in the religion of the Etruscans, and Persius’s elaborate
involution of the commonplace is parallel with the secret wisdom of his
countrymen. The minute detail of the Etruscan ritual has its counterpart
in the minute detail of Persius’s style, and the want of a due sense of
proportion and a certain coarseness of language in our author remind us
of the defects of Etruscan art and the harshness of the Etruscan
tongue.</p>

<p>Persius was born, if not to great wealth, at least to an ample
competence. His father died when the poet was but six years old, and his
education was conducted at Volaterrae under the superintendence of his
mother and her second husband, Fusius. For the proper appreciation of
the career of Persius, it is a fact of great significance that he seems
to have been very much under the influence of the women of his
household. To this influence he owed the purity of his habits; but
feminine training is not without its disadvantages for the conduct of
life. For social refinement there is no better school; but the pet of
the home circle is apt to make the grossest blunders when he ventures
into the larger world of no manners, and attempts to use the language of
outside sinners. And so, when Persius undertakes to rebuke the
effeminacy of his time, he outbids the worst passages of Horace and
rivals the most lurid indecencies of Juvenal.</p>

<p>When Persius was twelve years old he went to Rome,
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
as Horace and Ovid had done before him, for the purpose of a wider and
higher education, and was put to school with Verginius Flaccus, the
rhetorician, and Remmius Palaemon, the grammarian. Verginius Flaccus was
exiled from Rome by Nero, with Musonius Rufus, on account of the
prominence which he had achieved as a teacher, and Quintilian quotes him
as an authority in his profession. Remmius Palaemon, the other teacher
of Persius, a&nbsp;man of high attainments and low principles, was one
of the most illustrious grammarians of a time when grammarians could be
illustrious. A&nbsp;freedman, with a freedman’s character, he was
arrogant and vain, grasping and prodigal&mdash;in short, a&nbsp;Sir
Epicure Mammon of a professor. But his prodigious memory, his ready flow
of words, his power of improvising poetry, attracted many pupils during
his prolonged life, and after his death he was cited with respect by
other grammarians&mdash;a rare apotheosis among that captious tribe. The
first satirical efforts of ingenuous youth are usually aimed at their
preceptors, and the verses which Persius quotes in the First Satire are
quite as likely to be from the school of Palaemon as from the poems of
Nero.</p>

<p>But the true teacher of Persius, the man to whom he himself
attributed whatever progress he made in that ‘divine philosophy’ which
deals at once with the constitution of the universe and the conduct of
life&mdash;his ‘spiritual director,’ to use the language of Christian
ascetics&mdash;was Cornutus. Persius is one of those literary
celebrities whose title to fame is not beyond dispute; and while some
maintain his right to high distinction on the ground of intrinsic merit,
others seek with perhaps too much avidity for the accidents to which he
is supposed to owe his renown. If it is necessary to excuse, as it were,
his reputation, the relation of Persius to Cornutus
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
might go far to explain the care which schoolmasters have taken of the
memory of the poet. No matter how crabbed the teacher may be, how
austere the critic, the opening of the Fifth Satire, with its warm
tribute to the guide of his life and the friend of his heart, calls up
the image of the ideal pupil, and touches into kindred the brazen bowels
of Didymus.</p>

<p>Lucius Annaeus Cornutus, of Leptis in Africa, was a philosopher,
grammarian, and rhetorician. It has been conjectured that he was a
freedman of the literary family of the Annaei; and this is rendered
probable by the fact that Annaeus Lucanus, the nephew of Annaeus Seneca,
was his pupil. The year of his life and the year of his death are alike
unknown. He was banished from Rome by Nero because he had ventured to
suggest that Nero’s projected epic on Roman history would be too long if
drawn out to four hundred books, and that the imperial poem would find
no readers. When one of Nero’s flatterers rejoined that Chrysippus was a
still more voluminous author, Cornutus had the bad taste to point out
the practical importance of the writings of Chrysippus in contrast with
Nero’s unpractical project; and Nero, who had a poet’s temper, if not a
poet’s gifts, sent him to an island, there to revise his literary
judgment. Cornutus was not only a man of various learning in philosophy,
rhetoric, and grammar, but a tragic poet of some note, and perhaps a
satirist. Whether the jumble that bears the name of Cornutus or
Phurnutus, <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, is in any measure traceable to our
Cornutus, is not pertinent to our subject. Of more importance to us than
his varied attainments is his pure and lofty character, which made him
worthy of the ardent affection with which Persius clung to his ‘Socratic
bosom.’ It is recorded to his honor that Persius having bequeathed to
him his library
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
and a considerable sum of money, he accepted the books only and
relinquished the money to the family of Persius. Nor did he cease his
loving care for his friend after his ashes, but revised his satires, and
suppressed the less mature performances of the young poet.</p>

<p>The social circle in which Persius moved was not wide. The mark of
the beast called Coterie, which is upon the foreheads of the most
plentifully belaurelled Roman poets, is on his brow also. But it must be
said that the men whom he associated with belonged to the chosen few of
a corrupt time, albeit they would have been of more service to their
country if they had not recognized themselves so conspicuously as the
elect. The Stoic <i>salon</i> in which Persius lived and moved and had
his being reminds M.&nbsp;Martha of a Puritan household; it reminds us
of the sequestered Legitimist opposition to the France of yesterday. We
are so apt to see parallels when we are well acquainted with but one of
the lines&mdash;or with neither.</p>

<p>Let us pass in review some of the associates and acquaintances of
Persius.</p>

<p>Among his early friends was Caesius Bassus, to whom the Sixth Satire
is addressed: an older contemporary, who had studied with the same
master, next to Horace, by a long remove, among the Roman lyrists. To
his fellow-pupils belong Calpurnius, who is more than doubtfully
identified with the author of the Bucolics; and Lucan (Annaeus Lucanus),
the poet of the Pharsalia, who shared with him the instructions of
Cornutus, and is said to have shown the most fervent admiration of the
genius of his school-fellow. We are told that when the First Satire was
recited, Lucan exclaimed that these were true poems. Whether he
accompanied this encomium with a disparagement of his own performances,
or simply had reference to the modest disclaimer of Persius’s Prologue,
as Jahn is
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
inclined to think, does not appear. The anecdote is in perfect keeping
with the perfervid Spanish temper of Lucan and Lucan’s family. But this
momentary burst of admiration is no indication of any genuine sympathy
between the effusive and rhetorical Cordovan and the shy, philosophical
Etruscan. Nominally they belonged to the same school&mdash;the Stoic;
but Persius was ready to resist unto blood, Lucan’s Stoicism was a mere
parade.</p>

<p>While this anecdote leaves us in suspense as to the relations between
Lucan and Persius, we have express evidence that there was no sympathy
between Persius and Seneca. They met, we are informed, but the poet took
little pleasure in the society of the essayist. This is not the place to
attempt a characteristic of this famous writer, who, like Persius,
leaves few readers indifferent. Once the idol of the moralists&mdash;who
of all old birds are the most easily caught with chaff&mdash;Seneca has
fallen into comparative disfavor within the last few decades; yet
sometimes a vigorous champion starts up to do battle for him, such as
Farrar in England, and, with more moderation, Constant Martha in France;
and his cause is by no means hopeless if the advocate can keep his
hearers from reading Seneca for themselves. It is impossible not to
admire Seneca in passages; it seems very difficult to retain the
admiration after reading him continuously. The glittering phrase masks a
poverty of thought; ‘the belt with its broad gold covers a hidden
wound.’ To Persius, the youthful Stoic, with his high purpose and his
transcendental views of life, Seneca the courtier, the time-server, the
adroit flatterer, must have appeared little better than a hypocrite, or,
which is worse to an ardent mind, a&nbsp;practical negation of his own
aspirations. The young convert&mdash;and Persius’s philosophy was
Persius’s religion&mdash;in the first glow of his enthusiasm, must have
been repelled by the callousness
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
of the older professor of the same faith. And yet so strong was the
impress of the age that Persius and Seneca are not so far asunder after
all. To understand Persius we must read Seneca; and the lightning stroke
of Caligula’s tempestuous brain, <i>harena sine calce</i>, illuminates
and shivers the one as well as the other.</p>

<p>If the family of the Annaei did not prove congenial, there were
others to whom Persius might look for sympathy and instruction. Such was
M.&nbsp;Servilius Nonianus, a&nbsp;man of high position, of rare
eloquence, of unsullied fame. Such was Plotius Macrinus, to whom the
Second Satire is addressed, itself a eulogy. Even in his own family
circle there were persons whose lofty characters have made them
celebrated in history. His kinswoman Arria, herself destined to become
famous for her devotion to her husband, was the wife of <a name =
"intro_thrasea" id = "intro_thrasea">Thrasea Paetus</a>, and the
daughter of that other Arria, whose supreme cry, <span class =
"smallcaps">non dolet</span>, when she taught her husband how to meet
his doom, is one of the most familiar speeches of a period when speech
was bought with death. Thrasea, the husband of the younger Arria, was
one of the foremost men of his time, and bore himself with a moderation
which contrasts strongly with the ostentatious virtue of some of the
Stoic chiefs. He rebuked the vices of his time unsparingly, but steadily
observed the respect due to the head of the state; and even when the
decree was passed which congratulated Nero on the murder of his mother,
he contented himself with retiring from the senate-house. But Thrasea’s
silent disapproval of one crime fired Nero to another, and his refusal
to deprecate the wrath of the emperor was the cause of his ruin&mdash;if
that could be called ruin which he welcomed as he poured out his blood
in libation to Jupiter the Liberator.</p>

<p>That the familiar intercourse with such a man should
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
have inspired a youth of the education and the disposition of Persius
with still higher resolves and still higher endeavors is not strange.
That it sufficed, as some say, to penetrate Persius with the sober
wisdom of maturer years, and made up to him for the lack of personal
experience and artistic balance, is attributing more to association than
association can accomplish.</p>

<p>To Thrasea’s influence Jahn ascribes Persius’s juvenile essays in the
preparation of <i>praetextae</i>, or tragedies with Roman themes, and it
is not unlikely that a poetical description of his travels (<span class
= "greek" title = "hodoiporikôn">ὁδοιπορικῶν</span>) referred to some
little trip that he took with Thrasea. Thanks to Cornutus, this youthful
production&mdash;which doubtless was nothing more than a weak imitation
of Horace, or haply of Lucilius&mdash;was suppressed after the death of
the author, and with it his <i>praetexta</i>, and a short poem in honor
of the elder Arria also.</p>

<p>The purity of Persius’s morals, and the love which he bore his
mother, his sister, his aunt, stand to each other reciprocally as cause
and effect; and the occasional crudity of his language is, as we have
already seen, the crudity of a bookish man, who thinks that the sure way
to do a thing is to overdo it. Persius was a man of handsome person,
gentle bearing, attractive manners, and added to the charm of his

<p>He died on his estate at the eighth milestone on the Appian Road,
<i>vitio stomachi</i>, eight days before the kalends of December, A.U.C.
815&mdash;A.D. 62&mdash;in the twenty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>Cornutus first revised the satires of his friend, and then gave them
to Caesius Bassus to edit. The only important change that Cornutus made
was the substitution of <i>quis non</i> for <i>Mida rex</i> (1,121),
a&nbsp;subject which is discussed
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
in the Commentary. Other traces of wavering expression and <i>duplex
recensio</i> are due to the imagination of commentators, who attribute
to the young poet a logical method and an exactness of development for
which the style of Persius gives them no warrant. <i>Raro et tarde
scripsit</i>, the statement of the Life of Persius, explains much.</p>

<p>The poems of Persius were received with applause as soon as they
appeared, and the old <i>Vita Persii</i> would have us believe that
people scrambled for the copies as if the pages were so many Sabine
women. Quintilian, in his famous inventory of Greek and Roman
literature, says that Persius earned a great deal of glory, and true
glory, by a single book, and here and there the great scholar does
Persius homage by imitating him; and Martial holds up Persius with his
one book of price, as a contrast to the empty bulk of a half-forgotten
epic. But it would not be worth the while to repeat the list of the
admirers of Persius in the ages of later Latinity. It suffices to say
that he was the special favorite of the Latin Fathers. Augustin quotes
or imitates him often, and Jerome is saturated with the phraseology of
our poet. Commended to Christian teachers by the elevation of his moral
tone, by the pithiness of his maxims and reflections, and the energy of
his figures, he was set up on a high chair, a&nbsp;big school-boy, to
teach other school-boys, and scarcely a voice was raised in rebellion
for centuries. But since the time of the Scaligers, who were not to be
kept back by any consideration for the feelings of the Fathers, there
has been much unfriendly criticism of Persius; and the world owes him a
debt of gratitude for provoking an animosity that has opened the way to
a freer discussion of the literary merits of the authors of antiquity.
To be subject all one’s life through fear of literary death to the
bondage of antique dullness, as well as to the thraldom
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
of contemporary stupidity, would have been a sad result of the revival
of letters.</p>

<p>The first and last charge brought against Persius is his obscurity.
Admitted by all, it is variously interpreted variously excused,
variously attacked. Now it is accounted for by the political necessities
of the time. Now it is attributed to the perverse ingenuity of the poet,
which was fostered by the perverse tendencies of an age when, as
Quintilian says, <i>Pervasit iam multos ista persuasio ut id iam demum
eleganter dictum putent quod interpretandum sit</i>. Some simply resolve
the lack of clearness into the lack of artistic power; others intimate
that the fault lies more in the reader than in the author, whose
dramatic liveliness, which puzzles us, presented no difficulties to the
critics of his own century. But the controversy is not confined to the
obscurity of the satires, Persius is all debatable ground. Some admire
the pithy sententiousness of the poet; others sneer at his priggish
affectation of superiority. Some point to the bookish reminiscences,
which bewray the mere student; others recall the example of Ben Jonson,
of Molière, to show that in literature, as in life, the greatest
borrowers are often the richest men, and bid us observe with what rare
and vivid power he has painted every scene that he has witnessed with
his own eyes. To some he is a copyist of copyists; to others his real
originality asserts itself most conspicuously where the imitation seems
to be the closest. Julius Scaliger calls him <i>miserrimus auctor</i>;
Mr. Conington notes his kindred to Carlyle.</p>

<p>No critic has put the problem with more brutal frankness than
M.&nbsp;Nisard, who, at the close of his flippant but suggestive chapter
on Persius, asks the question, <i>Y&nbsp;a-t-il profit à lire Perse</i>?
Though he makes a faint show of balancing the Ayes and Noes, it is very
plain how he
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
himself would vote. The impatient Frenchman is evidently not of a mind
‘to read prefaces, biographies, memoirs, and commentaries on these
prefaces, these biographies, these memoirs, and notes on these
commentaries, in order to form an idea that will haply be very false and
assuredly very debatable, of a work about which no one will ever talk to
you, and of a poet about whom you will never find any one to talk to.’
But the question, which may be an open one to a critic, is not an open
one to an editor; and editors of Persius are especially prone to value
their author by the labor which he has cost them, by the material which
they have gathered about the text. The thoughts are, after all, so
common that parallels are to be found on every hand; the compass is so
small that it is an easy matter to carry in the memory every word, every
phrase; and so-called illustrations suggest themselves even to an
ordinary scholar in bewildering numbers, while the looseness of the
connection gives ample scope to speculation. Hence the sarcasm of Joseph
Scaliger: <i>Non pulchra habet sed in eum pulcherrima possumus
scribere</i>; and the well-known criticism of the same scholar: <i>Au
Perse de Casaubon la saulce vaut mieux que le poisson</i>. But this
artificial love on the part of the editors has not contributed to the
popularity of the author, and the youthful poet has been overlaid by his
erudite commentators. Besides this disadvantage, Persius, when he is
read at all, comes immediately after Juvenal, and, as if to enhance the
contrast, is generally bound up with him; and the homeliness of his
tropes, the crabbedness of his dialogue, the roughness of his
transitions repel the young student, who finds the riddance of the
historical and archaeological work which Juvenal involves a poor
compensation for the lack of the large manner and the dazzling rhetoric
of the great declaimer. On the other
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
hand, maturer scholars have been found to reverse the popular verdict,
and to say, with Mr. Simcox, that ‘the shy, youthful fervor of the
dutiful boy, combined with the literary honesty which kept Persius from
writing any thing which was not a part of his permanent consciousness,
makes him improve upon every reading, which is more than can be said of
Juvenal, who writes as if he thought and felt little in the intervals of
writing.’ But while it is easy to get tired of Juvenal, it is not so
easy to become enamored of Persius; and it must be admitted that the
pleasure is questionable. Yet, in spite of M.&nbsp;Nisard, there is no
real question about the utility of the study of the poet, who
illustrates by what he does not say even more than by what he says the
character of an age which is of supreme importance to the historian.
Even if we put the study on lower ground, we must admit that Persius’s
title to a prominent position in the annals of Roman literature is
indefeasible. However desirable it may be to get rid of him, an author
who has left his impress on Rabelais and Ben Jonson, as well as on
Montaigne and Boileau&mdash;an author whose poems have furnished so many
quotations to modern letters, can not be dismissed from the necessities
of a ‘polite education’ with a convenient sneer. Persius deserves our
attention, if it were only as a problem of literary taste.</p>

<p>To the end of the study of Persius, it is best to look away from the
conflicting views of the critics, and to abandon the attempt to
distinguish between the weight of facts and the momentum of rhetoric in
the balanced antitheses of praise and blame. The position of the poet
will be most accurately determined by the calculation of the statics of
his department and his age.</p>

<p>The Satire is the only extant form of Latin poetry that can lay claim
to a truly national origin; and the error
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
into which the early historians of classical literature were led by the
resemblance between the name of the Roman satire and the name of the
Greek satyr-drama has long been corrected. But the truth which this
error involves, the connection between the comic drama and the satire,
remains. The satire goes back to the popular source of comedy, and holds
in solution all the elements which the Greeks combined into various
forms of dramatic merriment. As the rhythmical movements, which
culminate in such perfections as the dactylic hexameter and the iambic
trimeter, are common to our whole race, and the rude Saturnian verse is
one with the heroic, so the rustic songs of harvest and vintage are
common to Greece and Italy; and it is no marvel that, as the satire was
working itself out to classic proportions, it should have felt its
kindred to Greek comedy, and should have drawn its materials and its
methods from that literature on which Roman literature in its other
departments was more directly dependent. And so the satire, though a
genuine growth of Italian soil, was none the less subject to Greek
influences. It was trained into Greek forms, it was permeated by Greek
thought; and here as elsewhere the retranslation into Greek, of which
the older commentators were so fond, is often the key to the meaning;
here as elsewhere our appreciation of the author, as a whole, is
conditioned by our knowledge of Greek literature.</p>

<p>Horace, the master of Roman satire, has more than once drawn the
parallel between satire and comedy; and Persius, who follows the
literary, though not the philosophical creed of his predecessor, aims
even more distinctly than Horace does at reproducing the mimicry of
comedy on the narrow stage of the satire. At the close of the First
Satire he goes so far as to demand of his readers the intense study of
the Old Attic Comedy as the preparation
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
for the enjoyment of his poems&mdash;an extraordinary demand, if we do
not make due allowance for the rhetorical expression of high aims and
earnest endeavors. A&nbsp;comparison of the triumvirate of the
<i>comoedia prisca</i> of Attica reveals little trace of direct
influence, abundant evidence of extreme diversity in expression and
conception. I&nbsp;say ‘expression,’ not ‘language.’ It is true that the
language of Persius has a virile tone, but the masculine energy of his
words is often out of keeping with the scholastic tameness of his
thoughts. The breezy Pnyx of the Athenian and the stuffy <i>lecticula
lucubratoria</i> of the Roman are not further apart than Aristophanes
and Persius.</p>

<p>The New Attic Comedy, the comedy of situation and manners, furnished
themes that lay nearer to the genius of Persius, although the grace of a
Menander was much further from his grasp than from Terence, the
half-Menander of Caesar’s epigram. One passage is all but translated
from Menander’s Eunuch; and if Persius did not borrow traits for his
picture of the miser and the spendthrift from the master of the New
Comedy, it was not for lack of models. Indeed, so unreal is Persius,
with all the realism of his language, that one of the most striking
features of his poems&mdash;the opposition to the military&mdash;loses
somewhat of its significance when we remember that the Macedonian
period, to which the New Comedy belongs, is crowded with typical
soldiers of fortune, with their coarse love of sensual
pleasure&mdash;their coarse contempt of every thing that can not be
eaten, drunk, or handled. Every line of Persius’s centurion can be
reproduced from the Greek; and although it would be going too far to say
that there was no counterpart to his sketch in his own experience,
although, on the contrary, Persius seems to have verified by actual
observation whatever he learned from books, the historical value of his
portrait is
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
very much reduced by the existence of the Greek type. As a specimen of a
kind of clerico-political opposition to an empire which its enemies
might call an empire of brute force and military mechanism, the
hostility of Persius to a class whose predominance was making itself
felt more and more is not without its point and interest, and it is
unfortunate that we have to leave its reality in suspense.</p>

<p>Yet another form of the comic drama was the Mime, and we have the
explicit statement of Joannes Lydus that Persius imitated the famous
mimographer, Sophron; and although the fragments of Sophron are so
scanty that this statement can not be verified, it is not without its
intrinsic probability. The mimetic power of Sophron is notorious, and
Persius might well have taken lessons from the man whom Plato
acknowledged as his master. The dialogue, thus borrowed from the mime,
became the artistic form of philosophic composition, and, as Persius’s
Satires are essentially moral treatises, it is not surprising that he
should have made large use of the same machinery. Plato himself
furnished the movement for two of his essays, and we can detect a
community of models between Persius and some of the later Greek writers.
Lucian, the mercurial, and Persius, the saturnine, often work on the
same theme, each in his way; and when the dialogue is dropped, and the
bustle of the drama is succeeded by the effects of the scene-painter’s
craft, we are reminded of another group of copyists, and find all the
picturesque detail for which Persius is so famous in the letters of
Alkiphron and Aristainetos, themselves far-off echoes of the New
Comedy.</p>

<p>Surely these are originals enough, the Attic Comedy, the Mime,
Sophron and Plato, Menander and Philemon. But we find other models
nearer home, and, passing by the reflections of Greek comedy in Plautus
and Terence,
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
its refractions in Afranius and Pomponius, we come to the satiric
exemplars of Persius&mdash;Lucilius and Horace. <i>Mox ut a scholis et
magistris divertit, lecto libro Lucilli decimo, vehementer saturas
conponere instituit.</i> This statement of the old <i>Vita Persii</i> is
much more consonant with the character of Persius than his own affected
mirthfulness. His ‘saucy spleen’ had as little to do with his verse
writing as righteous indignation with the rhetorical outpouring of
Juvenal. His laughter was as much a part of the conventionalities of the
satire as the <i>Camena</i> was of his confidences to Cornutus.
School-boys all imitate circus-riders; here and there one mimics the
clown; and Persius, who had not outgrown the tendencies of boyhood,
straightway began to make copies of verses in the manner of Lucilius. At
the same time he was too much under the influence of Horace to follow
Lucilius in his negligences, and too little master of the form to strike
the mean between slovenly dictation and painful composition. As an
imitator of Lucilius he boldly lashes men of straw where Lucilius
flogged Lupus and Mucius, and breaks his milk-teeth on Alkibiades and
Dama where Lucilius broke his jaw-teeth on living and moving enemies. As
an imitator of Horace he appropriates the garb of Horatian diction; but
the easy movement of roguish Flaccus is lost, and the stiff stride of
the young Stoic betrays him at every turn.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Old Attic Comedy, Persius’s intellectual
affinity with Lucilius was purely imaginary; and for the purposes of
this study it is unnecessary to reproduce the lines of Horace’s portrait
of the ‘great nursling of Aurunca,’ or to attempt to form a mosaic out
of the chipped chips of Lucian Müller’s recent collection. The wide
range of theme, the manly carelessness of style, the bold criticism, the
bright humor, the biting wit&mdash;in short,
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
almost every characteristic of Lucilius that we can distinguish, shows
how little kindred there must have been between the two men. The dozen
scattered verses of the Tenth Book of Lucilius, which is said to have
suggested the theme of the First Satire of Persius, and the fragments of
the Fourth Book, which is imitated by Persius in his Third Satire,
though more significant, give us no clew to the manner or the extent of
his indebtedness. Here and there a verse, a&nbsp;hemistich,
a&nbsp;jingle may have been taken from Lucilius, and he may have
enriched his vocabulary here and there from Lucilius’s store of drastic
words; but his obligations to Lucilius, real and imaginary, are all as
nothing in comparison with the large drafts which he drew on the
treasury of Horace.</p>

<p>The obligations of Persius to <a name = "intro_horace" id =
"intro_horace">Horace</a> have been the theme of all the editors. The
scholiasts themselves have quoted parallels, and Casaubon has written a
special treatise on the subject, and commentators, with almost childish
rivalry, have vied with each other in noting verbal coincidences and
similar trains of thought. The fact of the imitation is too evident to
need proof, and it would have been much more profitable to examine the
causes and significance of this dependence, and to study the
modifications of the language and the thought as they passed through the
alembic of Persius’s brain, than to multiply examples of words and
phrases that are common, not only to Horace and Persius, but to the
language of every-day life. Indeed, some go so far as to make Persius
quibble on Horace; and ‘How green you are,’ of the modern street, and
‘What means that trump?’ of the modern card-table, are as much
Shakespearian as some of Persius’s ‘borrowings’ are Horatian.</p>

<p>Horace had long been a classic when Persius dodged his school-tasks
and was a dab at marbles. Indeed, nothing
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
is more remarkable about Roman literature than the rapidity with which
the images of its Augustan heroes took on the <i>patina</i> of age. The
half-century that lay between Horace and Persius drew itself out to a
distant perspective, and Virgil and Horace had all the authority of
<i>veteres</i>. They not only dictated the forms of poetry, but
permeated and dominated prose. True, the hostility to Virgil and Horace
had not ceased; the <i>antiquarii</i> were not dead; but the ground had
been shifted. The admirers of republican poetry in the time of Horace
were republicans&mdash;in the time of Persius they were imperialists,
and the maintenance of the authors of the Augustan age as the true
classics was a part of the programme of the opposition. The court
literature of the Neronian period found its models in the earlier epic
essays of Catullus rather than in the poems of Virgil. Virgil had
modified the Greek norms to suit the Latin tongue; but these men went
back of malice aforethought to the Greek standard, and emulated the
proportions of the Greek versification of the Alexandrian period. They
were impatient of the classic vocabulary, and found the classic rhythms
tame, and so they betook themselves to the earlier language and set it
to more exact harmonies. It was no heresy with this set to consider
Virgil at once light and rough. The mouth-filling words of the older and
bolder period, marshaled in serried ranks, no gap, no break, as they
kept time to a rhythmical cadence that was marked by all the music of
consonance and assonance&mdash;this was the ideal of the school which
Persius assailed, just as an admirer of Pope or Goldsmith might assail
the dominant poetry of our day, with its sensuous melody and its revived
archaisms. Surely the worshippers of recent poets might pause before
accepting the narrow literary creed of Persius. But, not to imitate the
example of Nisard,
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
and indulge in dangerous parallelisms, it is sufficient for our purpose
to note that Persius’s close study of the language of Horace was not
only a part of a liberal education, but a necessity of the school to
which he belonged. If he was to write satire at all, he must needs take
Horace for his model. If he had written an epic, he would have taken
Virgil.</p>

<p>Besides this, we may boldly say that reminiscence is no robbery. The
verses, the phrases, the arguments that we know by heart often become so
wholly ours that they weave themselves unconsciously into the texture of
our speech. We use them as convenient forms of expression, without the
least thought of plagiarism. We quote them, thinking that they are as
familiar to others as they are to ourselves. They constitute, as it
were, a&nbsp;sympathetic medium between men of culture. And so Persius
repeated group after group of the words of Horace as innocently as the
Augustan poets translated their Greek models, and thought no more harm
than did the Emperor Julian when he Platonized, or Thackeray when he
transfused the classics that he learned at the Charter House into his
own matchless English. That he did it to excess is not to be denied. He
never learned the lesson of Apelles&mdash;what is enough.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly disposed of those turns which are common to the
Latin tongue, and those which ran freely into the pen of the writer, we
have now to deal with a considerable number of passages in which the
memory of Persius must have lingered over the words of Horace, in which
his painstaking genius has hammered the thoughts of Horace into a more
compact or a more angular utterance. To the majority of readers his
condensations and his amplifications will alike appear to be so many
distortions of the original. So, notably, where he characterizes Horace
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
himself, and substitutes for the simple <i>naso adunco</i> the puzzling
<i>excusso naso</i>, where ‘the dreams of a sick man’ become the ‘dreams
of a sick dotard,’ where ‘telling straight from crooked’ is twisted into
‘discerning the straight line where it makes its way up between crooked
lines,’ and where he wrings from the natural phrase ‘drink in with the
ear’ the odd combination ‘bibulous ears.’ In the longer passages the
wresting is still more pronounced; and those who refuse to take into
consideration the moral attitude of <a name = "intro_preach" id =
"intro_preach">Persius</a> may well wonder at the perversity with which
he distorts the lines and overcharges the colors of the original. But it
is tolerably evident that, with all Persius’s admiration of Horace as an
artist, he felt himself immeasurably superior to him morally, and looked
upon these adaptations and alterations as so much gained for the effect
of his discourse. The slyness of Horace might have answered well enough
for his day and for the kind of vices that he reproved, but the depth
over which Persius stood gave him a more than Stoic stature. Horace
might have been content with a flute; nothing less resonant than a
trumpet would have suited the moral elevation of Persius. Horace is a
consummate artist, and not less an artist in the conduct of his life
than in the composition of his poems. Persius is the prototype of the
sensational preacher, and preachers of all centuries, from Augustin and
Jerome to Macleane and Merivale, have had a weakness for him.</p>

<p>Aside from the moral tone, which is enough to give a different ring
to the most similar expressions in the two poets, there is an artistic
difference of great significance in the handling of the dramatic
element, which they both recognized as fundamental in the satire. The
dramatic satires of Horace will not bear dislocation without
destruction.
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
In Persius the characters are always shifting, always fading away into
an impersonal <i>Tu</i>. This may be partly due to the interval which he
allowed to elapse between the periods of composition; but it is possible
that he recognized the limitation of his own powers, that his satires
were intended to be a knotted thong, and not a smooth horsewhip. This
piecemeal composition, be it the result of poverty or of economy, makes
Persius the very author for ‘Elegant Extracts.’ Hence it is not hard to
defend him, as it is not hard to defend Seneca, and on similar grounds.
Single verses ring in the ear for months and years. What line, for
instance, more quoted than</p>

<p class = "poem">
<i>Tecum habita: noris quam sit tibi curta supellex</i>?</p>

<p>What line sinks deeper than the sombre verse,</p>

<p class = "poem">
<i>Virtutem videant intabescantque relicta</i>?</p>

<p>Single scenes, whether of dialogue or of description, possess every
requirement of dramatic vividness. On every page of the commentary we
call him bookish, and yet his pictures stand out from the canvas with a
boldness which makes us concede that his books did not keep him from
seeing, if they did not teach him to see, what was going on around him.
What is not a little remarkable in so young a man is the honesty of his
painting. A&nbsp;home-keeping youth, Persius gives us living pictures of
what he saw at home, whether at Rome, at Volaterrae, or at Luna; in the
school-room, in the lecture-room, in the court of justice, on the wharf,
at the country cross-roads. He has watched the carpenter stretching his
line, the potter whirling his wheel, the physician adjusting his scales.
He has heard the horse-laugh of the burly centurion, and shivered; has
heard, with a young Stoic sneer, a&nbsp;cooing and mincing declaimer. He
knows all about ink and paper and parchment and reeds; he has not
outlived
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
his knowledge of marbles, and one might fancy that the lustral spittle
of his aunty was still fresh on his brow. The fact that there is no
breeziness about his poems, nothing that tells us of the liberal air
beyond, is another sign of his truthfulness. His life is like his own
‘ever retreating bay’ of the Sixth Satire, with the cliffs of Stoic
philosophy between him and the wintry sea without. Arretium he
knows&mdash;it was not so far from Volaterrae&mdash;and Bovillae, in the
neighborhood of which he had a farm, and Luna, and the world of Rome;
but the rest of his geography is in the inane. Horace, on the other
hand, ambles all over Italy, and treats us every now and then to a
foreign tour with the air of a man who had run across the sea in his
time; and even if he who takes us in his sweeping flight from Cadiz to
Ganges be not the real Juvenal, the undisputed Juvenal has a far wider
geographical outlook than Persius. This very limitation is one of the
best signs of the artistic worth of Persius, and justifies the regret
that he had not made himself the Crabbe of Roman poetry.</p>

<p>We have seen that Persius was not slavishly dependent on Horace,
assimilated the material that he derived from him, raised the worldly
wisdom of Horace to the ideal standard of the Stoic, and followed a
different canon of dramatic art. To this we may add that Persius, with a
certain aristocratic disdain of conventionalities, goes deeper into the
current of vulgar diction than the freedman’s son dared. Persius felt
that he could afford to talk slang, and he talked it; and the
commentators have found it necessary to hold Petronius in the left hand,
as well as Horace in the right.</p>

<p>We now proceed to yet another formal element, which is no less
significant to the close student of antique literature. The Roman
handling of the hexameter was artificial
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
in the extreme. Reasoning backward from the Latin hexameter, scholars
have been prone to transfer the conscious symbolism of the Roman poets
to the Greek originals; and if they had stopped, say, at Apollonius
Rhodius, they might have been justified, for in the later Greek poets
something of the sort is not to be denied. But the healthier period of
Greek poetic art was lifted far above such toying adaptations of sound
to sense as commentators still discover in Homer when they enlarge on
the symbolism of this or that spondaic verse, the beauty of this or that
combination of diaeresis and caesura. A&nbsp;recent comparison of Homer
with his successors has shown that, of all the spondaic verses in Homer,
scarcely one in a hundred can be traced to any ‘picturesque’ motive, and
the rapid movement of so many five-dactyl hexameters is simply the
normal pace of the verse. When we come to Latin metres, however, we must
take a different standard, and recognize a conscious modification of the
Greek rule. The Ovidian pentameter of the best period&mdash;to cite a
familiar instance&mdash;is subject to minute laws, which are
transgressed at every turn in Greek elegiac poetry, and the different
ideals of Persius and Horace are distinctly traceable in their treatment
of the hexameter. Horace, as is well known, broke the lofty movement of
the hexameter to suit the easy gait of the satire. Persius is more
rhetorical than Horace, and, although he admits elision with as great
freedom as his master, his verse has a more mechanical structure than
the verse of Horace, and many of the conversational peculiarities of the
Horatian hexameter are much less conspicuous in Persius. Horace weakens
the caesura, employs a great number of spondaic words, and neglects the
variety at which the epic aims; and perhaps the trained ear of a
determined scholar might hear in the jog-trot of his satiric rhythms
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
the hoofs of his bob-tailed mule and the lazy flapping of his
portmanteau. Persius, on the other hand, hammers out his thoughts in a
far more orthodox cadence. Comparing the first six hundred and fifty
verses of the first book of the satires of Horace with the six hundred
and fifty verses of Persius, we find that more than eight per cent. have
five spondees against less than five per cent. in Persius. The so-called
third trochee or feminine caesura of the third foot is found in one of
ten of Horace’s hexameters, and only in one of twenty-six in
Persius&mdash;a low proportion even for a Latin poet. Still more
striking is the rare use which Persius makes of the masculine caesura of
the sixth foot, with its consequent monosyllabic close. Aside from all
idle symbolism, this arrangement, which is comparatively common in
Horace, gives the verse a certain familiar roughness, especially where
the final word forces a union with the following line. These diversities
can not be accidents, and serve to show that, although Persius might
weave himself a garment from the dyed threads of Horatian diction, he
was not bold enough to wear the <i>discincta tunica</i> of Horace’s
Muse. But we must not forget to be just, and it is only fair to add that
such a garb would have been as inappropriate to his severe and lofty,
though narrow spirit, as the Coan vestments of Ovid’s ‘kept
goddess’&mdash;if we may borrow the <i>déesse entretenue</i> of Heinrich
Heine.</p>

<p>A comparison of Persius with Juvenal&mdash;a favorite theme with
editors&mdash;does not enter into the plan of this study. It suffices
for our present purpose to note that the practiced rhetorician of the
time of Trajan could not have shared Quintilian’s admiration of his
youthful predecessor. The parallel passages which have been cited belong
to the common stock of satirical strokes or to the thesaurus of
proverbial phrases. Who can believe that
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
Juvenal took <i>usque adeo</i> from Persius, or borrowed from him the
familiar <i>rara avis</i>? There are three or four touches in the Tenth
Satire which recall some of the more striking expressions of Persius;
but Ribbeck’s objections to the genuineness of this sophistic
declamation, if not convincing, are at least sufficiently well founded
to make us pause in citing them. In moral earnestness, Persius is as far
superior to Juvenal as he is inferior to him in the rhetorical treatment
of his themes; and so long as men will take into consideration this
moral element, which modern critics are prone to eliminate from works of
art, so long as they will say <i>pectus est quod satiricum facit</i> as
well as <i>quod theologum</i>, Persius will command a personal esteem
which does not attach to the satires of Juvenal. The ingenious theory of
Boissier, that the great satirist of the Caesars was a snubbed snob,
brings out in still more striking contrast the figure of Persius as the
reserved provincial aristocrat, and may be worthy of a more ample
development than it has yet received. But Juvenal is a dangerous theme.
As M.&nbsp;Martha has admirably observed, Juvenal is an author whose
declamatory tone has infected his eulogists; and those who are not
carried away by an ‘admiration which disfigures while it exalts,’ may
readily be tempted into the opposite extreme. Let us turn, then, to
other matters which illustrate more directly the character of our
author’s compositions. And first a word or two of Stoicism.</p>

<p>With the strong practical tendencies of the Romans, the only systems
of Greek philosophy that ever found large acceptance at Rome were the
Epicurean and the Stoic; and in the Stoic school the only doctrines that
commanded much attention were the ethic. The subtle dialectic of the
Stoics, of which we have some unjoyous specimens in Cicero’s
philosophical compilations, was not
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
congenial to the Roman mind; but the Stoic creed was the creed of the
nobler spirits of the imperial time. Excluded from public life, or, at
all events, from the satisfactory exercise of public functions, the
elect few took refuge in Stoic philosophy.*</p>

<p class = "footnote">
* In this section of the Introduction I follow Zeller’s Essay on Marcus
Aurelius (<i>Vorträge u. Abhandlungen</i>) so closely that some special
acknowledgment seems to be necessary.</p>

<p>The object of Stoicism is by means of virtue and knowledge to make
men independent of all without them, and happy in that independence. It
is a pantheism: God revealed in every thing; God’s law recognized in
every thing; God the substance from which every thing proceeds, to which
every thing returns; the Original Fire, from which every thing is born
again. God is the all-pervasive Spirit, Fate, Providence. Obedience to
his eternal laws constitutes virtue and happiness. Good and evil are to
be measured by this standard. All that brings us toward this is Good;
all that carries us away from it is Evil. Every thing else is
indifferent.</p>

<p>In Grace or out of Grace, says the Christian; or, as Calvin expresses
it in his nervous language, <i>Qui Christum dimidium habere vult, totum
perdit</i>. In Virtue or out of Virtue, says the Stoic. There is nothing
between. The wise are perfectly wise; the foolish are totally foolish.
‘There is not a half-ounce of rectitude in the fool.’ The vicious man is
as mad as Orestes&mdash;nay, madder.</p>

<p>The difference between human beings is slight. Alkibiades, the
high-born and the handsome, is no better than shriveled old Baukis, who
makes her livelihood by selling greens. All external distinctions sink
into utter insignificance by the side of this great contrast of
knowledge and ignorance into which virtue and vice are resolved.</p>

<p>All humanity is one people; all the world one state;
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
its ruler the Deity; its constitution the eternal law of the universe.
The more unconditionally a man submits to the guidance of this law, the
more exclusively he seeks his happiness in virtue, the more independent
he will be of all without him, the more contented in himself, and yet
the readier to enter into communion with others, and to do his duty to
the whole of which he is a part.</p>

<p>But it is to be observed that the Stoicism of Persius, like the
Stoicism of Marcus Antoninus, was of a softer, milder, more religious
character than that of Zeno and Chrysippus; and when the Stoic
discourses on the nothingness of all earthly things, the ills of life,
man’s moral weakness, and his need of help, we hear language that
reminds us now of the epistles of the New Testament, now of the
doctrines of Buddha. ‘The philosopher,’ says Zeller, ‘is a physician for
the soul, a&nbsp;priest and servant of the Deity among men, and this he
shows by the most unlimited, devoted, unreserved philanthropy.’ And not
only so, but the Stoic does not disdain to make life brighter in the
social circle; and the Sixth Satire of our author, which Nisard
considers to be a youthful escapade of the poet&mdash;<i>qui s’évertue
comme un écolier qui sort de classe</i>&mdash;is no less truly Stoic
than the high-strung Third.</p>

<p>In speaking of this subject it is difficult to keep from using the
word religion, for the emotional element, which is so characteristic of
religion, is not wanting in a system which is the popular synonym for
suppression of emotion. This is the thesis which M.&nbsp;Martha has
brought out into clear relief, and illumined by many apposite
examples&mdash;a thesis which will not be strange to those who have
studied with any care the social aspects of the later life of antiquity.
Under the empire morality was more than morality&mdash;it was a
religion; and all the formulae of certain phases of Christian ascetics
may be applied to
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
the ethical side of Stoic philosophy. It is difficult to approach the
subject without seeming irreverence; but the faith of the Christian must
be far from robust who can shrink from a parallel that goes no farther
than the machinery&mdash;that does not involve the motive power. It is
not the aim of this study to determine whether this parallelism is to be
recognized as a <i>praeparatio Evangelica</i>, or as the like result of
similar forces at work in different systems of thought and belief. It is
enough to present the parallelism, to excuse the phraseology.</p>

<p>Our ancestors, at all events, were not afraid to recognize ‘natural
Christians’ in such men as Socrates, in such youths as Persius. Why,
even Seneca figured for a long time as St. Seneca; and Jeremy Taylor was
following old example when he cited the Stoic as well as the Christian
code. It is only one step from the recognition of this spiritual kindred
to the recognition of the practical methods of spiritual work as
anticipated in the life of antiquity&mdash;practical methods which for
our purposes are even better described by an unbeliever like Lucian than
by a believer like Marcus Antoninus. In that age of transition we find
father confessors, private chaplains, mendicant friars, missions,
revivals, conversions, ecstasies&mdash;all showing the deep needs of the
human heart, which refused to be satisfied with the outworn gods of the
Pantheon, and, in ignorance of the divine Person, who alone can answer a
personal love, sought solace in the mechanism of morality. In
characterizing Cornutus, I&nbsp;have already borrowed a phrase from
M.&nbsp;Martha, and called him, as M.&nbsp;Martha calls Seneca,
a&nbsp;spiritual director; and I have already ventured to call Persius a
sensational preacher. His stock of philosophy or theology is not as
large as some commentators suppose; and all the elaborate attempts to
show by the satires that Persius
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
was a thoroughly trained and consistent Stoic have failed. The most
elementary knowledge of Stoic ethics is sufficient for the comprehension
of Persius. Whatever else he knew he kept back for practical
considerations. He sticks to the marrow of morality, and reiterates the
cardinal doctrines of Stoicism with the vehemence of a Poundtext. This
vehemence, this enthusiasm, may be explained by his youth, his Etruscan
blood, his profession as a moral reformer. A&nbsp;critic with
M.&nbsp;Taine’s resources might account for it by the climate of
Volaterrae; but, however it may be accounted for, certain it is that he
himself is much impressed with the profundity of the doctrines which he
professes; that he warms and glows as he imparts to his auditors the
great secret that they are not free because they are slaves to vice;
that a man who does not understand his relations to his Maker can not
move a finger without sinning; that in the flesh there is no good thing;
and that the anguish of a tortured conscience is the worst of hells. But
the difficulties of Persius are not due to recondite Stoic thought, and
can not be cleared up by reference to Stoic philosophy. The trouble lies
in the slangy expressions, the lack of organic development, the restless
zeal to force his message home to the heart of every hearer, and the
consequent shifting of the personages of his dialogue to suit the cases
as they rose before his mind.</p>

<p>Persius, then, was a preacher of Stoicism&mdash;Stoicism, at once the
philosophy and the religion of a time when serious and noble natures had
no city of refuge except in their inmost selves, when the only possible
activity seemed to be submission to the inevitable. The hydrostatic
pressure of the imperial time forced all the better elements into this
mould; and in so far Persius bears the stamp of his period, and the very
absence of political and personal allusions
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
shows how imperfect life must have been. But one school of commentators,
headed by Casaubon, and represented to-day in Germany by Lehmann, in
England by Pretor, see in Persius much more than a disciple of the Stoa;
and the satires of our author&mdash;especially the First and
Fourth&mdash;are supposed to be full of more or less oblique references
to <a name = "intro_nero" id = "intro_nero">Nero’s</a> person, his
habits, his literary pretensions, his aristocratic birth. At one time it
seemed as if this thesis, which was suggested by the scholiast, had been
abandoned, but the field for historical ingenuity is too tempting; and
one of the vaguest of all the satires, the Fifth, has been discovered by
Lehmann to be full of the most stinging allusions to Nero. It is not
enough to grant to this school that Nero, as the type of his age, may
have been present to the mind of the author. They scornfully reject this
concession, and resort to all manner of legerdemain in order to explain
away the impossibilities of such an attack and the improbabilities of
its execution. With such scope as these scholars allow themselves we may
find parallels every where, and covert assaults may be detected in the
most innocent literary performances. But it would not answer the purpose
of this Introduction to enter into an elaborate discussion of this
question, which seems to be destined to an uncomfortable resurrection as
often as it is laid. Every plausible coincidence has been mentioned in
the Notes, and it will be sufficient for ingenuous youth to know the
opinions of distinguished scholars on the subject.</p>

<p>If this essay had not been prolonged beyond the limit proposed, it
might be well to give some account of the grammatical and rhetorical
peculiarities of the style of Persius; but the grammar of Persius will
present few difficulties to those who are at all familiar with the
poetic syntax of the Latin language; and enough has been
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvii</span>
said to prepare the student, in a measure, for coping with the labored
terseness of our author.</p>

<p>The manuscripts of Persius are remarkable for their age, their
number, and the stupid bewilderment of the transcribers. The best is the
<i>Codex Montepessulanus</i>, or Montpellier manuscript, with which the
<i>Codex Vaticanus</i> closely coincides; but, in the words of Jahn,
<i>Nullus Persii codex tantae auctoritatis est ut in rebus dubiis eius
vestigia tuto sequaris sed semper inter complures optio eaque non raro
incerta datur</i>.</p>

PROLOGUE.</a></h5>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;I never drank of
Hippocrene, never dreamed on Parnassus. The maids of Helicon and the
waters of Pirene are meat and drink for my masters&mdash;the
acknowledged classics&mdash;not for me, a&nbsp;poor lay-brother, with my
humble, homely song (<a href = "#lineP_1">1-7</a>). Others succeed: the
parrot with his Greek, the pie with her Latin. They have not dreamed on
Parnassus either; but they have a teacher&mdash;the great master
Belly&mdash;and Sixpence is their Phoebus Apollo. Hark how they troll
forth their notes! (<a href = "#lineP_8">8-14</a>).</p>

<p class = "argument">
Alas for me! no golden Muse, no silver sixpence inspires me. <i>Quis
leget haec?</i></p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p class = "argument">
This prologue is a survival of the dramatic element of the satire, as
Casaubon has remarked. Peculiarly personal, the prologue is found in the
earlier and in the later stages of art, in ballad literature and in
reflective poetry. The spurious verses which precede the
Aeneid&mdash;<i>Ille ego</i>&mdash;were intended to serve as a prologue,
and prologues in prose and poetry are familiar to the readers of <span
class = "smallcaps">Martial</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Statius</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Ausonius</span>,
and <span class = "smallcaps">Claudian</span>.</p>

<p class = "argument">
There is no good reason to doubt the genuineness of the prologue, or to
attribute the authorship to <span class = "smallcaps">Caesius
Bassus</span>, the Editor of <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>,
as Heinrich has done. Nor is there any sufficient ground for supposing
that the prologue is fragmentary. The two parts&mdash;of seven verses
each&mdash;do not hang well together, but the connection of the thought
is not so remote after all. ‘In the former part, <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span> ridicules the pretended source of the
poetical inspiration of his time, in the latter he exposes its real
origin’ (Teuffel).</p>

<p class = "argument">
More open to debate is the relation of the prologue to the satires. Is
it an introduction to all, or only to the first? It is true that the
prologue seems to belong especially to the first. Both furnish us with a
programme of the poet’s views, with a confession of faith which
consisted in a want of faith in the age; but as the First Satire itself
contains a vindication of the poet’s work, and forms an introduction to
the other five satires, it is safer not to restrict the prologue to the
narrower office.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<p class = "argument">
It is needless to say that these verses have not lacked admirers and
imitators. The latter half is parodied by Milton (<i>In Salmasii
Hundredam</i>), and the line <i>magister artis ingenique largitor</i> is
expanded by Rabelais (4, 59).</p>

<hr class = "tiny">
<p class = "argument">
The metre is the <i>scazon</i> or <i>choliambus</i> (G., 755; A., 82, 2,
<i>a</i>,&nbsp;R), and as the combination of different rhythms is one of
the peculiarities of the earlier <i>satura</i>, it is not unlikely that
<span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> followed an older pattern. In
<span class = "smallcaps">Petronius</span>, cap. 5, the choliambus is in
like manner followed by the hexameter, but the analogy is not close. The
choliambus, the invention of the great lampoonist <span class =
"smallcaps">Hippōnax</span>, is admirably adapted by its structure for
the expression of disappointment, vexation, discontent. The march of the
iambus is suddenly checked in the fifth foot, and the rapid measure
violently tripped up. It is a mischievous metre, and betrays in its
malice the Thersitic character of its inventor.</p>

The allusion is to <span class = "smallcaps">Ennius</span>, the <i>alter

‘<i>in</i> the spring.’ The Latin Abl. often has a locative translation,
when the conception is not necessarily or not distinctly locative. (G.,*
387.)&mdash;<b>prolui</b>: ‘drenched’ is designedly misused. The figure
is <i>Litotes</i>. (G., 448, R.&nbsp;2.) The greater the depression, the
greater the rebound. <i>Non prolui labra</i> = <i>ne primoribus quidem

<b>bicipiti</b>: ‘two-peaked.’ Parnassus is called <i>biceps</i>, either

the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf (<span class = "greek" title =
"dikorumbos ho Parnasos">δικόρυμβος ὁ Παρνασός</span>, <span class =

Castalian spring takes its rise.&mdash;<b>somniasse</b>: sc. <i>me
somniasse</i> (G., 527, R.&nbsp;2; M., 401). With <i>memini</i> the
Pres. Inf. is more common of Personal Recollection (G., 277,&nbsp;R; A.,
58, 11, <i>b</i>), but the Perfect is also found when the action is
distinctly recognized as a by-gone.

who believe that the Satires of <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>
were aimed at Nero, see in <i>semipaganus</i>, ‘half-educated,’ as well
as in the last seven verses, a&nbsp;deliberate disguise of the poet’s

FIRST SATIRE.</a></h5>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">This</span> Satire is an attack on the
literature of the day as the efflorescence of the corruption of the
times. The age is personified by a critical friend, but it is not always
easy to determine when the poet is speaking and when the friend, or when
the satirist is meeting an imaginary objection from some other imaginary
quarter. The unreality of the whole dialogue is confessed with more
candor than art in <a href = "#line1_44">v. 44</a>. Instead of a firm
outline, we have a floating <i>quisquis es</i>.</p>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The poem opens with a
line, which <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> recites to his man
of straw, who forthwith urges him to abandon authorship (<a href =
"#line1_1">1-3</a>). The poet acknowledges that he is at odds with his
generation and expects no applause at their hands. But little does he
care for their praise; let them prefer a Labeo to him. Their standard is
not his standard. He is his own canon. He will not, can not follow the
advice of his friend. He must obey the impulse of his temper and speak
out (<a href = "#line1_4">4-12</a>).</p>

<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<p class = "argument">
Whether we write laborious verse or laborious prose&mdash;so the attack
begins&mdash;it is all one; display and applause are the aim and object
of both. The style is fustian; the delivery wanton; the theme prurient.
The bard is little better than a bawd (<a href = "#line1_13">13-23</a>).
And yet so deeply rooted is this love of praise that learning is loss,
unless it be minted into golden opinions, and knowledge is naught until
it be known of men. To be pointed out as a lion, to be used as a school
classic&mdash;what glory! (<a href = "#line1_24">24-30</a>). Oh, yes!
A&nbsp;glory shared by the dainty ditties, the mewling elegies of
lisping, snuffling dandies, for this is what calls forth the approval of
the after-dinner circle. Such is the praise that is to bless the poet
even after death! (<a href = "#line1_30">30-40</a>). It is true that
fame is not to be despised. No poet but feels his heart vibrate to
praise. But the popular acclaim is not the ultimate standard. Mad epics,
elegies thrown off in a surfeit, effusions of aristocratic easy-chairs
are alike lauded. A&nbsp;man feeds the hungry and clothes the naked, and
then asks for a candid opinion. Mockery of criticism! (<a href =
"#line1_40">40-62</a>). The taste of the people relishes nothing but
smooth verses&mdash;verses without flaw or break, faultless
machine-verses&mdash;which answer any turn, and serve alike for satire,
for eclogues, for heroic strains (<a href = "#line1_63">63-75</a>).
Others, again, call themselves passionate pilgrims to the well of Latin
undefiled, and linger over the obsolete magniloquence of <span class =
"smallcaps">Pacuvius</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Accius</span>.
A&nbsp;fine <i>olla podrida</i>&mdash;this jumble of modern affectation
and ancient trumpery (<a href = "#line1_76">76-82</a>). Bad as this is
in literature, how much worse it is to find that the jargon of the
<i>salon</i> has become the language of the courts, and that the manly
Roman speech is dead. Even in a matter of life and death, the accused
thinks more of his rhetorical than of his judicial sentence, and listens
for a ‘Pretty good,’ as if that were the verdict (<a href =
"#line1_83">83-91</a>). It will not do to say that great improvements
have been made in the art of verse. Smooth are the verses and resonant,
but at the cost of sense, of manly vigor. Once catch the trick, and any
body can reel off such lines (<a href = "#line1_92">92-106</a>). Ears
are ticklish, our satirist admits. Truth is an unwelcome rasp, and the
cold shoulder of great men no toothsome meal. Police regulations are
stringent. ‘Commit no nuisance’ is posted every where. Ah, well! It was
otherwise in the time of Lucilius. That was a free world in which he
craunched Lupus and Mucius. It was otherwise in the time of Horace. That
was a gay world, in which he tickled while he taught. And is the poet
not to mutter even? King Midas’s barber told his master’s secret to a
ditch. Where can a ditch be found? Here in this book (<a href =
"#line1_107">107-121</a>). Few readers can our author hope or
desire&mdash;only such as have studied closely the great masters of the
Attic sock, not such as ignorantly make a mock of Greek attire and Greek
science, pride themselves on petty local honors, and rise to no higher
conception of wit or fun than a dog-fight or a jibe at personal
infirmity (<a href = "#line1_122">122-134</a>).</p>

<p><b>1-7.</b> At the very outset we encounter a difficulty in the
distribution of the first lines between&nbsp;P. (Persius) and

arrangement followed in the text may be explained thus:</p>

<p>P. (<i>is discovered absorbed in contemplation. He recites a line

<p>M.&mdash;Who will read this stuff of yours?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A lame and impotent conclusion!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Why so? Am I to fear that Polydamas and the Trojan dames
shall make up their minds to give Labeo the preference over me? Stuff!
Don’t assent, when muddled Rome rejects a thing as light weight, and do
not trouble yourself to get the faulty tongue of that pair of scales to
work right, and look not outside of yourself for what you can find only
within yourself.</p>

<b>decor:</b> Gr. <span class = "greek" title =

offences against <i>iunctura</i> that <span class =
"smallcaps">Quintilian</span> enumerates, and do not avail themselves of
the license which he accords to a <i>grata neglegentia</i>. There is no
elision, no synaloepha, in any of them. As these fashionable verses have
been held up to derision by the satirist, commentators have been busy in
hunting out defects, and translators have vied with each other in absurd
renderings. But Jahn has wisely warned us against an over-curious search
into the supposed faults of these verses, which Vossius pronounced
superior to any thing in the compositions of the critic himself. It is
enough for us to know that to the ear of <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span> the lines lacked masculine vigor. The
multiplication of diaereses, the length of the words, the careful
avoidance of elision, the dainty half-rhyme of <i>bombis</i> and
<i>corymbis</i>, the
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
jingle of <i>ablatura</i> and <i>flexura</i>, may be cited as
confirmations of the view of <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>,
but, with the exception of the desperate <a href = "#line1_95">verse
95</a>, the diction is in keeping with the theme. If <i>adsonat Echo</i>
is not ridiculous in <span class = "smallcaps">Ovid</span> (Met., 3,

<i>reparabilis</i> is not a happy adjective for Echo, who is always

<b>cludere versum:</b> like <i>concludere versum</i> (<span class =

the subject? ‘Our man,’ ‘our poet,’ the lover of <i>decor et

subject. The personification of <i>iunctura</i> would not be too harsh
for <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>.&mdash;<b>Berecyntius

<b>Nerea:</b> god of the sea, the water. In modern Gr. <span class =

is as likely.</p>

Alpes et nubifer Appenninus</i>; and Haupt’s note. ‘We filched a rib
from the long Apennine.’ The interpretations are all unsatisfactory. The
scholiast sees in the removal of the rib from the mountain a metaphor
for the removal of a syllable from the hexameter. The only point worthy
of notice in this remark is the emphasis laid on the spondaic verse. The
<i>Graece nugari soliti</i> doubtless used spondaic verses more freely
than the model Latin poets (comp. <span class =
"smallcaps">Catull.</span>, 64). Some understand the words to refer to a
forced march (<i>putavi tam pauca milia <span class =

attributed to Hannibal in crossing the Alps (<i>montem rumpit aceto</i>,
<span class = "smallcaps">Juv.</span>, 10, 153). It is all idle
guess-work, without a context; but, guess for guess, the expression
would suit a ‘Titanomachia,’ and the rib might answer for a weapon, as
once a jaw-bone did. The jingle of the verse is like <span class =

peculiarly significant. So the metrical structure of the first verse of
the Iliad is very different from that of the first verse of the Odyssey.
<i>Arma virum</i>, etc., with its short words and its frequent caesurae,
was harsh to the ear of the interlocutor, and is compared with the
rough, cracked bark of the cork-tree.&mdash;<b>spumosum et cortice

<b>vegrandi subere:</b> So Jahn, instead of <i>praegrandi subere</i>. Do
not translate ‘huge, overgrown bark’ (Conington), but ‘dwarfed, stunted
cork-tree.’ See Ribbeck (<i>Beiträge zur Lehre von den lateinischen

some length. Both Conington and Pretor admire the metaphysics of Jahn,
who has ‘explained, after <span class = "smallcaps">Festus</span> and
<span class = "smallcaps">Nonius</span>, <i>vegrandis</i> as <i>male
grandis</i>, so as to include the two senses attributed to it by <span

<i>ve-sanu-s</i>, ‘out of one’s sound senses;’ <i>ve-grandi-s</i>,
‘shrunken,’ ‘dwarfed,’ ‘undergrown’ (if the word is admissible). For the

<i>Arma virum</i> as an invocation of the shades of <span class =

rejoinder, it is not very appropriate. ‘If the Aeneid is rough, give us
something really soft,’ would be a fit reply to <i>Arma virum</i>, etc.,
in the mouth of the objector. Conington, who gives 96-98 to <span class

(<i>sera parsimonia in fundo est</i>, <span class =

reading, which makes <i>nummus</i> the subject. The personification is
in <span class = "smallcaps">Persius’s</span> vein, as Schlüter
correctly remarks. Comp. <i>tacita acerra</i>, <a href = "#line2_5">v.

<i>nequiquam</i> may be considered the exclamation of the <i><span class
= "gesperrt">nummus</span></i>. This gives so happy a turn that I am
almost tempted to put it in the text. It is the familiar story of ‘the
bottom dime,’ set to the familiar tune of the ‘Last Rose of Summer.’
Jahn makes the numbskull, not the <i>nummus</i>, the subject, and reads
in his ed. of 1843:</p>

<p class = "poem">
<i>Nequiquam fundo</i>, suspiret, <i>nummus in imo</i>!</p>

<p>In his ed. of 1868 he follows Hermann, who reads:</p>

<p class = "poem">
Nequiquam <i>fundo</i>, suspiret, <i>nummus in imo</i>!</p>

<p>Pretor prints:</p>

<p><b>52-75.</b>
With a sudden start <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> strikes at
the root of the matter&mdash;the false conception of the divine
character. ‘Thou thoughtest,’ saith God, ‘that I was altogether such a
one as thyself,’ Ps. 50, 21. Because you love gold, you fancy that God
loves gold, and judge of His Holiness by your corruption. God demands a
pure heart, and not ‘thousands of rams.’ This is a plane on which the
highest expressions of the most various religions meet, so that Hebrew,
Greek, and Christian hold almost identical discourse. M.&nbsp;Martha
(<i>Moralistes Romains</i>, p. 134) recognizes ‘a progress’ in thoughts,
which are immemorial in their antiquity.</p>

THIRD SATIRE.</a></h5>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The Satire opens
dramatically. A&nbsp;young Roman of the upper classes is discovered
asleep, snoring off the effects of yesterday’s debauch. To him one of
his familiars, half companion, half tutor, who rouses him by telling him
that the sun is already high in the heavens, and it is time to be up.
The young fellow bawls for his servants, brays for them, and makes a
show of going to work. But nothing suits him. He curses the ink because
it is too thick, then he curses it because it is too thin, and finally
swears at pen and ink both. ‘You big baby,’ exclaims the monitor. ‘Do
you expect me to study with such a pen?’ asks the young man with a
whine. ‘Don’t come to me with your puling nonsense, you dab of
untempered mortar, you unformed lump of clay. You are lazing away the
time, when every minute is of moment, when the potter’s wheel should fly
faster and faster, and deft hands should mould the vessel of your life
(<a href = "#line3_1">1-24</a>). But I see you think that you have
already attained perfection. You are satisfied with your position in
life, move in a good circle. Tell that to the profane vulgar.
I&nbsp;know you, every inch of you. Shame on you, that you, with your
training, should live like a brutish creature, who does not know what a
rich jewel he is flinging away, who sinks without a struggle in the
slough of vice, whose soul dies and makes no sign. But you, who know
better, will have a dire fate. No worse doom could Jove himself bring
down on cruel tyrants than the vain yearning for lost virtue, which they
can never hope to regain. Nay, worse than the brazen bull of Phalaris
and
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
the pendent sword of Damocles is the consciousness of sin, the pallor
that blanches not the cheek only, but the very heart (<a href =
"#line3_25">25-43</a>). You are past the age of childhood, and have not
the excuse of tender years. If you were a child, I&nbsp;could understand
your behavior. I&nbsp;remember my own childhood, how hateful and
unprofitable task-work alternated with frivolous play, how I dodged the
learning of the piece I had to speak, how I had no thought for any thing
save dice and marbles and tops (<a href = "#line3_44">44-51</a>). But
you have reached a higher level. You know the great norms of life, the
doctrines of the Porch; you understand the distinctions of Right and
Wrong. Pshaw! As I live, you are snoring still. Wake up, I&nbsp;say, and
tell me&mdash;have you any aim in life? Or are you nothing better than a
boy following sparrows with a pinch of salt?’ (<a href =

Here the poet drops the dramatic form, deserts the individuality of the

<p class = "argument">
‘Be wise to-day; ’tis madness to defer.’ Go back to the first principles
of all true philosophy, the constitution of the universe, the position
of man in that universe, the great laws of Ethic as derived from the
great laws of Physic. In brief, study your Stoic catechism. Do not allow
yourself to be diverted from higher study by success in the lower ranges
of life. You lawyer there, for instance, do not let hams and sprats, the
gifts of thankful clients, seduce you from the ambrosia of true
philosophy (<a href = "#line3_63">63-76</a>).</p>

Such men as the centurion are hopelessly lost, have already ‘imbodied
and imbruted.’ Like Natta, they are unconscious of their moral ruin. But
there are those who, half-conscious of their condition, consult a
physician of the soul, a&nbsp;spiritual director. The state of this
class is set forth in a dramatic parable. A&nbsp;man feels sick, goes to
see a doctor, follows his advice for a while, gets better, and then,
despite all remonstrance, violates the plainest rules of diet and falls
dead (<a href = "#line3_88">88-106</a>).</p>

But before our preacher can make the application, he is interrupted by

According to Jahn, this Satire is aimed at those that have received a
thorough training in ethics, but, owing to the weakness of human nature,
fail to follow the true guide of life; and, although well aware of their
short-comings, imitate the example of those brutish souls whose sins are
excused by their ignorance. In short, the Satire is an expansion of the
old theme&mdash;<i>Video meliora proboque</i>.</p>

<p class = "argument">
Knickenberg (<i>De Ratione Stoica in Persii Satiris Apparente</i>, p. 16
seqq.) maintains that in conformity with Stoic doctrine, it is not so
much the weakness of human nature as imperfect knowledge&mdash;the
<i>inscitia debilis</i> of <a href = "#line3_99">v. 99</a>&mdash;that is
the source of the vices which the author lashes in the present Satire.
According to the Stoic, virtue is knowledge, and the snoring youth, with
his half-knowledge, which keeps him from rising to the height of virtue,
is the pattern of the false philosophy of the time.</p>

<p class = "argument">
But <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> is not an expounder of the
Stoic philosophy, as a system, any more than <span class =
"smallcaps">Seneca</span> is; and commentators have attributed to him a
profounder knowledge of philosophy than he had, certainly a profounder
knowledge than it would have been artistic to show. <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span> repeats the catechism of the sect, expands
some of their favorite theses, elaborates some of their pet figures, and
finds fault with his fellow students in the lofty tone which he had
caught from his teachers. A&nbsp;glaring paradox, such as we find in
<a href = "#line5_119">5, 119</a>, he is but too happy to reproduce, but
the subtle analysis for which the Stoics were famous does not appear in
his poems.</p>

<p>The preacher takes up his parable. A man feels sick, consults a

draught of wine. He meets a friend, perhaps his medical friend, on the
way. ‘My dear fellow, you are pale as a
ghost.’&mdash;‘Pshaw!’&mdash;‘Look out! You are yellow as saffron, and
bless me! if you are not swelling.’&mdash;‘Pale? Why, you are paler than
I am. Don’t come the guardian over me. My guardian has been dead a year
and a day.’&mdash;‘Go ahead, I’m mum.’&mdash;He goes ahead, stuffs
himself, takes his bath. While he is drinking a chill strikes him, and
he is a dead man. No expense spared on the funeral. ‘You can’t mean that
for me,’ says a literalist. ‘If I’m sick, you are another. I&nbsp;have
no fever, no ague.’ Nay, but you are subject to the worst of
diseases&mdash;to the fever of covetousness, the fever of lust, to
daintiness with its sore mouth, to fear with its cold chill, and, worse

FOURTH SATIRE.</a></h5>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">The</span> theme of this Satire is contained
in the closing verses. It is the Apollinic <span class = "greek" title =
"gnôthi sauton">γνῶθι σαυτόν</span>. Want of self-knowledge is the fault
which is scourged. The basis is furnished by the Platonic dialogue,
known as the First Alcibiades, and the characters are the same. The
person lectured under the mask of Alcibiades is a young Roman noble, in
whom commentators of a certain school have recognized the familiar
features of Nero.</p>

<p class = "argument">
<span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;Socrates is supposed to
be addressing Alcibiades. You undertake to engage in politics? You rely
on your genius, do you? What do you know of the norms of right and
wrong, you callow youngster? What do you know of the subtle distinctions
of casuistry, that you undertake to say what is just and what is unjust?
You have a goodly outside, but that is all, and you are fitter for a
course of hellebore than for a career of statesmanship. What is your end
and aim in life? Dainty dishes and basking in the sunshine? The first
old crone you meet has the same exalted ideal. Or do you boast of your
descent? You praise your lineage, you trumpet forth your beauty, just as
yon market-woman cries up her greens (<a href =
"#line4_1">1-22</a>).</p>

<p class = "argument">
You do not know yourself. Who knows himself? Every one sees his
neighbor’s faults, no one his own. You sneer at the curmudgeon who
groans out a health over the sour stuff he gives his laborers on a
holiday (<a href = "#line4_23">23-32</a>). And while you make mock at
him, some fellow, who is standing at your side, nudges you with his
elbow, and tells you that you are as bad as he, though in another way
(<a href = "#line4_33">33-41</a>). And so we give and take punishment.
This is our plan of life. We hide our faults from ourselves. We get
testimonials from our neighbors to impose on our own consciences. Awake
to righteousness! Put your goodness to the test! If you yield to the
temptation of covetousness, of lust, in vain will you drink in the
praises of the rabble. Reject what you are not. Let Rag, Tag, and
Bobtail take away their tributes. Live with yourself, and you will find
out how scanty is your moral furniture (<a href =
"#line4_42">42-52</a>).</p>

<p class = "argument">
Jahn regards this Satire as the earliest of the six, and it certainly
shows even greater immaturity than the others. The well-known
individuality
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
of Socrates is coarsely handled, the irony lacks the subtle play, the
mischievous good-nature of the great Athenian; and though the glaring
anachronisms may be defended by such exemplars as <span class =
"smallcaps">Horace</span> (notably in Sat., 2,&nbsp;5), there is all the
difference in the world between the sly humor of the older poet, who
peeps from behind the Greek mask and winks at the Roman audience, and
the grim contortions of the beardless representative of the bearded
master.</p>

<p class = "argument">
The indecency of a part of the Satire is considered by Teuffel a valid
objection to the view taken by Jahn, but the imagination of early youth
and the experience of corrupt old age often meet in disgusting detail,
and the obscenities of bookish men are among the worst in literature.
Add to this the peculiar views of the Stoic school as to the corruption
of the flesh (<a href = "#line2_63">2, 63</a>), and the consequent Stoic
tendency to degrade the body by the most contemptuous representations of
physical functions, and we can the more readily understand how <span
class = "smallcaps">Marcus Antoninus</span>, the purest character of his
time, should have besmirched his Meditations with passages which lack a
parallel for their crudity; and why <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span>, the poet of virginal life, should have
outdone the <i>praegrandis senex</i> of Attic comedy in the coarseness
of his expressions.</p>

gods, when all about me humored me, and when the dress of manhood
permitted my eyes to rove at will through the Subura with all its wares

ignorant of life, brings the excited mind to the spot where the great
choice of roads is to be made&mdash;in that decisive hour I made myself
son to you, and you took me, Cornutus, to your Socratic heart. Where my
character was warped, the quiet application of the rule of right
straightened what in me was crooked. My mind was constrained by reason,
wrestled with its conqueror, and took on new features under your forming
hand. How I remember the long days I spent with you, the first-fruits of
the festal nights I plucked with you. Our work, our rest we ordered both
alike, and the strain of study was eased by the pleasures of a modest

Liberty&mdash;not such as gives a dole of musty meal, a&nbsp;soup-house

the twinkling of an eye. Now Dama is a worthless groom, and would sell
himself for a handful of provender. Anon he is set free, as you call
it&mdash;becomes Marcus Dama. Excellent surety! Most excellent judge! If
Marcus says it is so, it is so. Your sign and seal here, good Marcus.
Pah! This is the liberty that manumission gives. Up speaks Marcus:
‘Well! Who is free except the man that can do as he pleases? I&nbsp;can

<p class = "argument">
‘Do what you please!’ cries <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>,

thing about the conduct of life with all its perplexities. As well
expect a man to teach an elephant to dance the tight-rope. Reason bars
the way, and whispers, “You must not do what you will spoil in the
doing.” This is nature’s law, the law of common-sense. You mix medicine,
and know nothing of scales and weights? You, a&nbsp;clodhopper, and
undertake to pilot a ship? Absurd, you say; and yet what do you know of
life? How can you walk upright without philosophy? How can you tell the
ring of the genuine metal, and detect the faulty sound of the base
alloy? Do you know what to seek, what to avoid, what to mark with white,
what with black? Can you control your wishes, moderate your expenses, be
indulgent to your friends? Do you know how to save and how to spend? Can
you keep your month from watering at the sight of money, from burning at
the taste of ginger? When you can say in truth, “All this is mine,” then
you are truly free. But if you retain the old man under the new title,
I&nbsp;take back all that I have granted. You can do nothing that is
right. Every action is a fault. Put forth your finger&mdash;you sin.
There is not a half-ounce of virtue in your silly carcass. You must be
all right or all wrong. Man is one. You can not be virtuous by halves.
You can not be at once a ditcher and a dancer. You are a slave still,
though the praetor’s wand may have waved away your bonds. You do not
tremble at a master’s voice, ‘tis true, but there are other masters than
those whom the law recognizes. The wires that move you do not jerk you

This Satire is justly considered by many critics the best of all the
productions of <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>, as it is the
least obscure. The warm tribute to his master Cornutus may have had its
share in commending the poem to teachers, who, of all men, are most
grateful for gratitude. But apart from this revelation of a pure and
loving heart, the peculiar talent of <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span>, which consists in vivid portraiture of
character and situation, appears to great advantage in this composition.
True, the introduction is not wrought into the poem, and the poet’s
discourse is too distinctly a Stoic school exercise, and reminiscence
crowds on reminiscence, but there is a certain movement in the Satire,
or Epistle, as it were better called, which carries us on over the
occasional rough places, without the perpetual jolt which we feel every

The drift of the passage is plain enough. ‘A change of fortune does not

possess, then you are free and wise. But if you are, after all, the same
old man, I&nbsp;take back all that I have granted. You are a fool,
a&nbsp;slave.’ This familiar Stoic thesis is covered over with a mass of
confused metaphors, at least according to the commentators and
translators.&mdash;<b>pelliculam veterem retines:</b> is supposed to

<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<b>politus:</b> words that do not fit in very satisfactorily with ass,
fox, flat wine, restiff beast, or buzzing cock-chafer. My admiration of
<span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> is not unqualified, but this
medley is almost too wild even for his turbid genius; and here, as
elsewhere, commentators have been misled by looking at mere verbal
coincidences with <span class = "smallcaps">Horace</span>. There is an
Aesopic fable (149 Halm), the moral of which gives the substance of this
passage: <span class = "greek" title = "ho logos dêloi hoti hoi phauloi tôn anthrôpôn, kan ta proschêmata lamprotera analabôsi, tên goun phusin ou metatithentai">ὁ λόγος δηλοῖ ὅτι οἱ φαῦλοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων, κἂν τὰ
προσχήματα λαμπρότερα ἀναλάβωσι, τὴν γοῦν φύσιν οὐ μετατίθενται</span>.
In this fable, which bears a family likeness to <span class = "greek"
title = "walê pot’ andros">ϝαλῆ ποτ᾽ ἀνδρός</span> (<span class =
"smallcaps">Babr.</span> 32), <i>La Chatte Metamorphosée en Femme</i>
(<span class = "smallcaps">La Fontaine</span>, 2, 18), Zeus, charmed
with the cleverness of Reynard, had made him king of the beasts; but
wishing to try whether fortune had changed his character, he caused a
beetle to fly before His Majesty’s eyes as he was borne by in state. The
fox could not withstand the temptation, leaped from the litter, and
tried to catch the game in such unseemly guise that Zeus deposed him.
The fox is Dama, made Marcus; nay, become a philosopher (<i>nostrae
farinae</i>), and the philosopher is king: <i>sapiens&mdash;dives</i> |
<i><span class = "gesperrt">liber</span>, honoratus, pulcher, <span

if despite his fair seeming, his smooth regal brow (<i>fronte

the old Reynard&mdash;the old rascal that swindled his master for a feed
of corn&mdash;is still in his heart (<i>astutam servas sub pectore

forcibly recalls the connection between comedy and satire.</p>

<p><b>132-160.</b>
Avarice finds you snoring, makes you get up, thrusts a bill of lading in
your hand, cuts out work for you&mdash;not very honest work
either&mdash;and chides you till she gets you to the ship. As you are
about to embark, Luxury takes you aside, remonstrates with you, reminds
you of the annoyances of a sea voyage. And all for what? The difference
between five and eleven per cent. Why so greedy? ‘Life let us cherish.’
Enjoy it while you may. And so you are in a strait betwixt two. First
you submit to one, then to the other master; and when you have once
rebelled, you must not say, ‘I have broken my bonds.’ So a struggling
hound may wrench away the staple, but drags the chain after it.</p>

The distribution of what follows is not clear. Jahn and Hermann make
Davus’s speech end with <i>dicas</i>, so that <i>haud mora</i> is the
reply which the slave puts into the mouth of his master. ‘If she should
call you, you would say: “Anon, anon, mistress.”’ Chaerestratus speaks
the words from <i>Quidnam</i> to <i>accedam</i>, and Davus concludes
with <i>si totus&mdash;nec nunc</i>. If Jahn’s view be adopted,
I&nbsp;do not see how we are to reject the old conjecture <i>ne tunc</i>
or <i>nec tunc</i> for the reading <i>ne nunc, nec nunc</i>, <a href =
"#line5_174">v. 174</a>. According to Heinrich, followed by Macleane and
Conington, <i>haud mora</i> is adverbial, and the words
<i>quidnam&mdash;accedam</i> are attributed by Davus to Chaerestratus.
‘In <span class = "smallcaps">Terence</span>,’ says Conington, ‘the

whether to obey it. In <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> he is
trying to resolve under the pressure of disappointment, and even then
can not make up his mind; so that his servant tells him that if he
<i>should</i> be summoned back, he is pretty sure to entertain the
question.’ I&nbsp;have followed Heinrich’s arrangement. Speech within

as metaphor within metaphor.</p>

Consider the claims on me. Here comes a glorious piece of news from the
Emperor. The Germans have been defeated with great slaughter.
A&nbsp;grand triumph is preparing. This is no time to hold back.
I&nbsp;am going to bring out a hundred pairs of gladiators in honor of
the occasion. Forbid it, if you dare. If you don’t like that, I&nbsp;am
going to give largess to the people&mdash;none of your vile vetches, but
oil and pasties. Do you object? Out with it (<a href =

What do you say? ‘My farm is hardly worth having after that.’ Well, if
you don’t want it, I&nbsp;can get some of the women to take it; and if
there is none of them left, I&nbsp;can go to the next village, and Hodge
will accept. ‘A son of earth?’ you say; ‘a nobody?’ Pshaw! If you come
to that, I&nbsp;can just remember who my great-great-grandfather was.
Two generations further back and I come to a son of earth,
a&nbsp;nobody, and Hodge is a relation&mdash;a distant relation, but
still a relation&mdash;a kind of great-great-uncle. Believe me, the Lord
No Zoo is father of us all (<a href = "#line6_52">52-60</a>).</p>

You are an impatient heir, I must say. Why can’t you wait for my shoes

is painted in the pictures, with a purse in his hand. Will you take what
I leave, and be glad to get it? It falls short; I&nbsp;know it does. But
if I have lessened it, it is for myself that I have lessened it, and
what is left is all yours. Don’t stop to ask about that old legacy, and
serve up a stale dish of fatherly advice. I&nbsp;know how fathers talk.
‘Credit yourself by the interest. Debit yourself by the expenses. What
is the remainder?’ Remainder? Fudge! Souse the cabbage, boy. Don’t spare
the oil. Am I to dine off cow-heel and turnips on a holiday, that your
graceless grandson may stuff himself with <i>pâté de foie gras</i>, and
indulge himself in aristocratic connections? Am I to go through the eye
of a cambric needle that he may have a priestly paunch? (<a href =

<p class = "argument">
Furthermore, if you are not content with the little that I can leave
you, sell your life for gain. Try every trade. Try every nook and corner
of the earth. Go to Cappadocia, for instance, where you can make
something by dealing in slaves, and become an adept in that dainty
business. Double your capital. ‘I have done so. Nay, I&nbsp;have trebled
it, quadrupled it, decupled it. Tell me where to draw the line.’ Tell
you where to draw the line? Why, Chrysippus himself could not find the
limit between wealth and poverty. A&nbsp;dollar more does not make a man
rich, a&nbsp;dollar less does not make him poor. Where is the
turning-point? And yet this man talks as if the turning-point had been
found! (<a href = "#line6_75">75-80</a>.)</p>

The Sixth Satire is the most obscure and unsatisfactory of the poems of
<span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span>, and baffled interpreters have
taken refuge in the hypothesis that the Satire is incomplete. The
roughness of the metre and the harshness of the transitions favor this
view; but parts are wrought
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
out with all the minuteness of detail that is characteristic of our
author’s style, and some of the highest authorities, such as Jahn,
consider the Satire complete. The close, as Mr. Pretor remarks, is

with the author of a treatise on Metres, which is referred to by various
grammarians, and still exists in an interpolated epitome, but different
from Gabius or Gavius Bassus, who wrote works on the origin and

in his narrow sphere, <span class = "smallcaps">Persius</span> has hit

he was only seven years old when it took place; but he lost his father

made an abiding impression, whether he saw it or only heard of it.
Caligula’s German expedition is recounted in <span class =

was to be unprecedentedly splendid, and cheap in proportion, as he had a

<b>dic clare:</b> It were very much to be wished that he had. The
context seems to require, on the one hand, a&nbsp;motive for the silence

The interpretation of <i>non adeo&mdash;iuxta est</i> depends on
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
the meaning of <i>exossatus</i>, which is sometimes rendered
‘exhausted,’ ‘impoverished,’ ‘worn out,’ as if ‘boneless’ and
‘marrowless’ were the same thing here; sometimes, and with far more
probability, ‘cleared of stones.’ A&nbsp;poetic allusion to the ‘bones
of Mother Earth,’ <span class = "smallcaps">Ov.</span>, Met., 1, 393
seqq. (Schol.), would be out of place, and the common culinary sense of
<i>exossatus</i>, ‘boned,’ is in keeping with the homely character of
<span class = "smallcaps">Persius’s</span> tropes. <i>Adeo</i> is
sometimes considered a Verb, in the sense of <i>adire hereditatem;</i>
sometimes an Adverb, and connected now with <i>prohibeo</i> (from
<i>prohibes</i>), now with <i>exossatus</i>; and, finally, some give
<i>exossatus&mdash;est</i> to the heir, others to <span class =
"smallcaps">Persius</span>. I&nbsp;subjoin the chief distributions and
interpretations:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(1.) <i>Non adeo</i>, inquis. Exossatus ager iuxta est. Jahn (1843). (Do
you mean to hinder me? Out with it.) ‘Not exactly,’ you say. Here is a
worn-out field hard by. If you won’t have it, another will.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(2.) ‘Non adeo,’ inquis? Exossatus ager iuxta est (Conington). You won’t
accept the inheritance, you say? Here is a field, now, cleared for
ploughing.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(3.) ‘Non adeo,’ inquis, ‘exossatus ager iuxta est,’ Jahn (1868), which
may be rendered, ‘I am sure that your land here is not in such very good
order’ (that you can afford such extravagance). Good order or not,
I&nbsp;can find some one to take it off my hands, etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(4.) Hermann bases his interpretation on the Schol., and understands
<i>non adeo exossatus ager</i> to be a field that is not wholly cleared
of stones, to which the heir points as a cogent argument against his
making a difficulty. He is afraid of a stoning from the people, as above
he was afraid of doing any thing to disoblige the Emperor (<i>Lect.
Pers.</i>, II., 64).</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(5.) Teuffel agrees with Hermann’s interpretation of <i>exossatus</i>,
but separates <i>non adeo</i>, ‘Not exactly.’ See (1.). ‘There is a
field hard by from which the stones have [just] been dug up,’ where they
are lying in convenient heaps.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(6.) Heinrich takes <i>adeo</i> to be the Verb, <i>exossatus</i> as
‘impoverished,’ and <i>iuxta</i> = <i>paene</i>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(7.) <i>Non adeo</i>, inquis. <i>Exossatus ager iuxta est</i> is
rendered by
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
Mr. Pretor, ‘I can’t quite forbid it; but let me suggest to you that
your land is impoverished.’</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(8.) König understands the heir to say: ‘I will not accept. I&nbsp;have
a well-tilled piece of land of my own hard by.’</p>

<p>I am not ashamed to acknowledge that the only point about which I am
convinced is the impossibility of making <i>exossatus</i> mean
‘impoverished.’</p>
